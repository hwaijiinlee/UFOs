# UFOs - Fact or Fiction
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to build a webpage that contains UFO sightings around the world, that allows readers to filter on their desired date, city, state, country, and even shape of the UFOs sighted.

## Results
The webpage is built such that upon landing on the page, all information is displayed without filters. There are placeholders in each of the filterable fields to give the readers a hint on how to filter the information.

If the reader wants to review all sightings on a particular date, they would just have to enter the date and the table to the right would automatically only show recorded sightings on the selected date.

If the reader wants to review all sightings in a particular city, state, or country, they would just have to enter those specific city, state, and country. The table to the right would automatically only show recorded sightings on the selected parameters.

We have even included the shape of the UFO for readers to filter on! If the reader wants to review all UFO sightings that are triangle in shape, all they have to do is enter in "triange" in the shape filter and the table on the right will then only show sightings of UFOs that are triangle in shape.

## Summary
### Drawback of the current design 
If readers want to start over, they have to either refresh the page or delete the filters they entered. That might not be very intuitive for less internet savvy readers.

### Recommendations for further development
1) Include a "Clear Filters" button to allow the readers to click on and reset the table data to unfiltered state; and
2) Include an interactive map that has pins indicating sightings in that region that readers can click on or hover over and a pop-up would show the sighting information of that particular pin.
